## Overview of Project
The client has asked for a website that can filter through a static dataset of UFO sightings (stored as *data.js*).  While simple, the page will be able to quickly filter down by:
 - Date
 - City
 - State
 - Country
 - Shape of the UFO 

We used HTML and Bootstrap for the aesthetics and JS for the funtionality.  

## Site Results
We were able to build a simple page based on the the table data given.  With no filters entered, the website lists all of the sightings:

Additionally, you can see when sorting by just selected filters.  In this case, *Date* and *State*:

## Summary

### Superlatives
- No generate or action button, filters work simply by entering data
- We can choose to use any number of the filters, including zero

### Challenges
- Case sensitive
- Shape should probably be renamed 

### Recommendations
- Allow for any case
- Broaden the date format
      - to take it futher, perhaps a date range
- Rename *Shape*
